Briefs-util
===========

A group of utilities for creating/managing briefs and briefcasts


BS
---

BriefScript is a concise, forgiving, human-readable language for describing the scenes and actors in a Brief, and BS is the command-line utility for compiling your BriefScripts into the machine-readable Brieflist format required by Briefs.


TextMate Support
----------------

A TextMate bundle is included for easing development of BriefScripts. The BS utility must be installed to /usr/bin/ to use the bundle's syntax validator and converter.

Protip: drag and drop an image into your BriefScript document and an actor will be auto-generated for that image.
